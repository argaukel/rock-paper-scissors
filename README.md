# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors game in Javascript

Capturing keyboard input from the user, when r (for rock), p (for paper), or s (for scissor) is hit and release the game will run.

using math.floor and math.random a random number between 0 & 2 will be generated to generate the "computer's" response in kind.

the responses from user and "computer" are compared to determine if scissor cuts paper, rock crushes scissor or paper wraps rock.

The two answers are recorded and displayed, along with a running score.
